# Smart Lights App

This app is a school project - where focus was on object oriented programming. Its purpose was to communicate with the physical lamps provided by school (Philips Hue bulbs) via the bridge and Philips Hue API for developers.

Not deployed as it is only working on the local bridge and its API.
